  This snippet renders meta data needed to create a Pinterest Rich Pins.
  Pinterest uses Open Graph, developed by Facebook. Be sure to enable
  'Facebook Open Graph Tags' in your theme settings too as some meta
  tags overlap and are not included here.

  Your cards must be validated by Pinterest to be activated
