Shopify Timber
=====================

Timber is a theme framework for Shopify that helps you get your store up and running quickly. It provides all required theme templates, a starter set of liquid tags, and some basic styles and modules for you to extend on.

Styling and customization is left up to you. Some base styles and helpers are included, but there is **no need to remove any code before you start**. Simply download and get designing.
